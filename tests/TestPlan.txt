Type of Tests
Unit tests -> cover single functions, make sure they work with expected ouput
Integrated automation tests -> cover the integration between input file and solver program (implemented from the test cases below)

Test Cases
1. invalid boards:
1) invalid board format (10*9 board, uneven rows, etc)
expected result -> return console "This is an invalid board"
3) board with insufficient numbers
expected result -> return console "There is more than one solution for this board."
4) invalid board with invalid numbers (same number in the same row/column/subgrid)
expected result -> return console "This is an invalid board"
5) board with no solution
expected result -> return console "There is no solution"
2. valid boards:
1) solved board
expected result -> return console of "LEVEL: EASY" and a prettier print of the board
2) board with only one empty spot
expected result -> return console of "LEVEL: EASY" and a prettier print of the board
3) easy board
expected result -> return console of "LEVEL: EASY" and a prettier print of the board
4) not easy board
expected result -> return console of "LEVEL: HARD" and a preattier print of the board
